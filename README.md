# SnakeGame
A Java Swing implementation of a Snake Game

This is a simple clone of the game Snake. Playing is as easy as running the program and then clicking start or pressing enter.
Controls from there are simple arrow keys. Manuever around the playing field, grabbing as many red apples as you can, while avoiding running into the walls or yourself!

The game also has highscore functionality! See if you can beat it!
