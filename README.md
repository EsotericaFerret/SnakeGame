# SnakeGame
A Java Swing implementation of a Snake Game

This is a simple clone of the game Snake. Playing is as easy as running the program and then choosing a difficulty, which resizes the window for an easier or harder experience.
Controls from there are simple arrow keys. Manuever around the playing field, grabbing as many red apples as you can, while avoiding running into the walls or yourself!

The game also has highscore functionality for each difficulty! See if you can beat the Insane score!
